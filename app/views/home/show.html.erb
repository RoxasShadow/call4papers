<h1>Great to see you here</h1>

  <p>Our 2013 Call for Proposals has now ended. We have really enjoyed reading
    your proposals.</p>

  <p>Our notification process began at the end of May. We strive to write to
    each proposer personally. If you haven't heard from us yet, you should
  expect to hear from us by the second week of June.</p>
